This Command Line Interface (CLI) project is an ambulance dispatch system designed to efficiently manage emergency medical services. It enables users to find contact details of hospitals so as to dispatch ambulances, and assign them to emergency incidents. This README file provides an overview of the project and instructions on how to use it.


## Features

Ambulance Dispatch: The system allows users to dispatch available ambulances to respond to emergency incidents in real-time.
Ambulance Tracking: Users can track the real-time location of ambulances on a map to monitor their movements and availability.
Incident Assignment: The system enables users to assign dispatched ambulances to specific emergency incidents based on their proximity and availability.
Status Updates: Users can update the status of ambulances, such as en route, at the scene, or transporting patients, to keep track of their progress.
